# Crystal Ball Drop Simulator (React Native CLI + TypeScript)

This is a React Native CLI application written in TypeScript that simulates the **two-crystal ball (egg dropping) problem** using the optimal two-ball strategy.  
It includes **auto-simulation** modes to visualize how the algorithm determines the breaking floor with minimal drops in the worst case.

üß† Algorithm Explanation

The app solves the two-crystal ball problem:

Given a building with n floors and 2 crystal balls that break if dropped from floor f or higher, find the smallest such f with the minimum number of drops in the worst case.

Strategy

Compute the smallest integer k such that:

k * (k + 1) / 2 >= n


This ensures that in the worst case, no more than k drops are required.

Drop the first ball at floors:

k, k + (k-1), k + (k-1) + (k-2), ...


until it breaks.

Once the first ball breaks at some floor, use the second ball to linearly scan floors between the last safe floor + 1 and the breaking floor.

Example

For n = 10, the optimal k = 4

First ball drop sequence: 4, 7, 9

If the first ball breaks at 7, scan floors 5, 6, 7 with the second ball

Worst-case drops = 4
